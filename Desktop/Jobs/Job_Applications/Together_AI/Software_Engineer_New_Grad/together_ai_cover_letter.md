Dear Together AI Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer - New Grad position at Together AI. As a recent MS Computer Science graduate from Indiana University with a passion for building scalable systems and optimizing performance-critical code, I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to your mission of lowering the cost of modern AI systems through innovative co-design of software, hardware, algorithms, and models.

Your commitment to open and transparent AI systems resonates deeply with my own values and experience. During my academic and professional journey, I've consistently focused on building robust, user-focused solutions while contributing to collaborative development environments. My experience spans the full technology stack - from low-level system optimization at Nokia where I improved system reliability by 22%, to customer-facing UI development at Indiana University where I built scalable feedback systems serving 1,000+ users.

What particularly draws me to Together AI is your groundbreaking work on FlashAttention, Hyena, FlexGen, and RedPajama. My technical background aligns well with your needs: I've architected scalable data pipelines processing 200,000+ transactions hourly with 98.92% accuracy, built CI/CD pipelines that accelerated deployments by 25%, and developed machine learning models using AWS services that improved forecasting accuracy by 12%. My experience with distributed systems, performance optimization, and cloud platforms directly supports your infrastructure goals.

I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where I can contribute ideas to shape technical direction. At Nokia, I championed software quality by maintaining 92.4% code coverage through rigorous testing frameworks. In my academic projects, I've demonstrated my ability to work effectively in Agile teams while building production-ready applications like CourseCraft (a full-stack LMS with multi-factor authentication) and Smart Form (an NLP-based system achieving 95% accuracy in duplicate detection).

My recent coursework in Applied Algorithms, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Big Data Applications has strengthened my foundation in computer science fundamentals while keeping me current with modern development practices. I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to learn and adapt to new tools and technologies while working alongside passionate researchers and engineers who are building the future of AI infrastructure.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in scalable system design, performance optimization, and collaborative development can contribute to Together AI's innovative work. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
