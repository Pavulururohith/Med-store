# Cover Letter - Voxel Software Engineer - Platform

**Date:** September 14, 2025

Dear Voxel Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer - Platform position at Voxel. Your mission to protect the nearly 3 million workers injured annually in preventable workplace incidents deeply resonates with me—having witnessed firsthand how technology can create meaningful safety improvements during my work on real-time alert systems that enhanced public safety monitoring across a 10km radius.

As a recent Master's graduate from Indiana University Bloomington (3.97 GPA) with hands-on experience in distributed systems and computer vision, I bring exactly the combination of fresh perspectives and practical expertise that Voxel needs for its Platform team. My academic foundation in Applied Machine Learning, Big Data Applications, and Computer Networks, combined with production experience processing over 1 million real-time data points, positions me perfectly to contribute to your next-generation intelligent video analytics platform.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the direct alignment between my experience and Voxel's core technical requirements. At Nokia Solutions and Networks, I architected large-scale distributed systems using **Kafka** and **Kubernetes**—the exact technologies mentioned in your job posting—improving system reliability by 22% while implementing comprehensive monitoring and observability. This experience translates directly to building the video ingestion and processing systems that power Voxel's industrial safety platform.

My computer vision expertise makes me particularly well-suited for this role. At Nano Robotics Embed Technologies, I developed **computer vision and ML pipelines** using **AWS services (IoT Core, Lambda, Kinesis, SageMaker)**, achieving 12% improvement in model accuracy while processing massive real-time datasets. More importantly, I built a **real-time alert system with video analytics** that enhanced safety monitoring—experience that directly applies to Voxel's mission of preventing workplace incidents before they happen.

The platform engineering aspects of this role align perfectly with my background in **containerized services and microservices architecture**. I have practical experience using **Kubernetes** to deploy, monitor, and manage containerized workloads, having built production-grade CI/CD pipelines that accelerated deployments by 25% while achieving 50% reduction in container image sizes. My familiarity with **Infrastructure as Code** practices using **Terraform**, combined with extensive **AWS** experience, positions me to help scale Voxel's perception systems across both edge devices and cloud infrastructure.

I'm particularly drawn to the collaborative nature of this position. Throughout my experience, I've thrived in cross-functional environments—from working with ML engineers and researchers at Indiana University to collaborating with product stakeholders at Nokia. My project building a real-time video analytics platform involved coordinating with multiple teams to bring computer vision models into production, exactly the kind of collaboration that drives innovation at Voxel.

Having learned that CEO Vernon O'Donnell is also an Indiana University Bloomington alumnus, I'm excited about the shared connection to an institution that values both academic rigor and practical innovation. This connection reinforces my belief that Voxel's culture of continuous learning and technical excellence would be an ideal environment for my continued growth.

The opportunity to work on systems that directly impact worker safety is incredibly meaningful to me. My experience building resilient backend services with 98.92% accuracy, maintaining 92.4% code coverage, and processing hundreds of thousands of transactions hourly demonstrates my commitment to the high standards in code quality and operational excellence that safety-critical applications demand.

As someone early in my career (0-2 years experience), I bring fresh energy and perspectives while having already proven my ability to deliver production-ready systems in collaborative environments. I'm excited about the chance to contribute to Voxel's technical direction while continuing to learn from AI experts, experienced entrepreneurs, and passionate problem-solvers.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in distributed systems, computer vision pipelines, and production ML deployment can contribute to Voxel's mission of revolutionizing workplace safety. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of joining your visionary team in protecting the essential workers who power our world.

Best regards,
