## üìã Job Application Generation Rules

### Critical Requirements

When the user requests generation of a new job application (formatted job description, tailored resume, and cover letter), the AI assistant must:

1. **Read the base resume** from `@Rohith_Pavuluru/rohith_resume.tex`
2. **Read user-specific data** from `@Data/reference_data/` files
3. **Read instructions and conventions** from this README_AI.md file
4. **Create a new folder** under `@Job_Applications` named after the company (e.g., "Microsoft")
5. **Inside that folder, generate:**
   - `job_description.md` (with headings and bulleted requirements)
   - `tailored_resume.tex` (customized from rohith_resume.tex)
   - `cover_letter.md` (addressed to the hiring team, reflecting the role and location)
6. **Name files consistently** following the naming convention below
7. **Include a top-level README** with a brief summary

### üö® CRITICAL FILE NAMING CONVENTION

All files must follow this exact naming pattern:

- **Job Description:** `<company_name>_job_description.md`
- **Resume Files:** `<company_name>_<role_abbreviation>_resume.tex` AND `<company_name>_<role_abbreviation>_resume.md`
- **Cover Letter:** `<company_name>_cover_letter.md`

**Examples:**

- `charles_schwab_job_description.md`
- `charles_schwab_sre_resume.tex`
- `charles_schwab_sre_resume.md`
- `charles_schwab_cover_letter.md`

**MANDATORY:** Always create both .tex and .md versions of the resume with identical naming convention.

## üìù ATS Optimization Requirements

### Critical ATS Compatibility

- **Layout:** Use simple, clean single-column layouts (avoid complex multi-column designs)
- **Fonts:** Standard fonts only: Arial, Calibri, Helvetica, Times New Roman, or Georgia (10-12pt body text)
- **Section Headings:** Use conventional headings: "Contact Information," "Professional Summary," "Skills," "Work Experience," "Education," "Certifications," "Projects"
- **Formatting:** No tables, text boxes, graphics, logos, or information in headers/footers
- **Bullet Points:** Standard bullet points only
- **Compatibility:** Must work with both traditional ATS and AI-powered screening tools (2025 update)
- **üö® RESUME LENGTH: EXACTLY 1 PAGE** - Must fit all content on single page through strategic condensation

### Keyword Optimization Standards

- **Target Match Rate:** Aim for **75-90% keyword match** with job descriptions (updated 2025 standard)
- **Keyword Format:** Include both acronyms and full terms (e.g., "Large Language Models (LLMs)", "Machine Learning (ML)")
- **Natural Integration:** Mirror exact language from job postings naturally across summary, skills, and bullet points
- **Placement:** Distribute keywords across all resume sections

### Professional Summary Requirements

- **Length:** 1-3 lines maximum for ATS parsing
- **Job Title:** Include exact job title from posting
- **Keywords:** Integrate 3-5 key technical keywords naturally
- **Quantification:** Include years of experience or key achievements

---

## üö´ AI Detection Avoidance - Critical Implementation

### Writing Variability Requirements

- **Sentence Structure:** Mix short (5-8 words) and long (15-25 words) sentences randomly
- **Forbidden Words:** Avoid AI buzzwords: "leveraged," "utilized," "optimized," "enhanced," "delve," "embark," "realm," "testament"
- **Natural Language:** Use contractions naturally: "can't," "won't," "I've"
- **Sentence Variety:** Vary sentence openings to avoid repetitive patterns

### Work Experience Bullet Point Formula

**Structure:** [Action Verb] + [Technology/Method from Job Description] + [Quantified Impact]

**Example:** "Developed machine learning models using PyTorch and scikit-learn, improving prediction accuracy by 23% for financial document analysis"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Quality Assurance Checklist

Before presenting any job application, verify:

- [ ] **RESUME IS EXACTLY 1 PAGE** - No exceptions, condense content if needed
